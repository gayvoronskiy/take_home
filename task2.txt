SSL Offloading is very CPU consuming process.
So here I will monitor CPU load.
As well as I need to monitor load (bandwidth) on network cards, to make sure that no packet drop are ocurred.
For proxy functionality I guess in addition we need to monitor free disk space as well as disk performance.
For both cases we can use almost any agent-based monitoring system. In our case it will be Nagios as it is already in production.
